# ðŸ‘€ Docker-Watch

docker-watch is a simple Node.js script to watch for container creation and deletion, and execute a command.

It is available as a CLI, docker image, and Node.js module.

## Features

- ðŸ‘€ Watch for container creation and deletion
- âš¡ Execute a command when a container is created or deleted
- ðŸŽ¨ Customizable
- ðŸ¦¾ Crash-free (I hope, had no crashes so far)
- ðŸ’¡ Simple to use

## Installation

### CLI

```bash
npm install -g @docker-watch/cli
```

Usage:

```bash
docker-watch --command "docker exec nginx nginx -s reload" --on "start, destroy"
# Or for more customization, with a config file
docker-watch --config ./config.yml
```

### Docker

```bash
docker run -d --name docker-watch --pid=host --privileged -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /path/to/config.yml:/docker-watch.yml docker-watch/docker-watch:latest
```

Or with docker-compose:

```yaml
services:
    docker-watch:
        image: docker-watch/docker-watch:latest
        volumes:
            - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
            - /path/to/config.yml:/app/docker-watch.yml
        restart: always
        pid: host # Required to allow docker-watch to run docker commands, and commands on the host machine
        privileged: true # Also required for the same reason
```

**WARNING: while we do provide a docker image to run docker-watch, it is not the recommended way to run it, as you need to execute commands through nsenter to run them on the host machine. This can be a security risk (and also makes the whole thing harder to use), and we recommend running docker-watch directly on the host machine.**

Make sure that your config file executes the command with `nsenter` like so:

```yaml
global_command: 'nsenter -t 1 -m -u -n -i sh -c "docker exec nginx nginx -s reload"' # This uses nsenter to run the command in the host namespace
events:
    - name: "start"
    - name: "destroy"
```

### Node.js

If you wish to do anything using our API, you can install the module:

```bash
npm install @docker-watch/core
```

And use it in your code:

```javascript
const { DockerWatchBase, parseConfig } = require("@docker-watch/core");

const config = parseConfig("./config.yml");
const dockerWatch = new DockerWatchBase(config);

// Your custom logic
dockerWatch.on("start", (container) => {
    console.log(`Container ${container.name} started`);
});
```

## Configuration

The configuration file is a YAML file with the following structure:

```yaml
global_command: "docker exec nginx nginx -s reload" # Command to execute on event, can be overridden by container-specific command
conditions:
    env: # Only execute the command if the container has the following environment variables
        KEY: VALUE
    container: # Only execute the command if the container has the following name
        - name: "my_container"
          value: "my_value"
events:
    - name: "start" # Event name
      command: "docker exec nginx nginx -s reload" # Command to execute on event
      conditions: # Conditions to execute the command
          env: # Only execute the command if the container has the following environment variables
              KEY: VALUE
          container:
              - name: "my_container" # Only execute the command if the container has the following name
                value: "my_value"
```
